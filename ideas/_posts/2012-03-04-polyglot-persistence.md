What's my persistence mechanism and why you might want to do that. 

Should I use MongoDB, Riak, SQLite, MySQL, SOLR/Lucene, or CouchBase to store my data? Maybe the best answer is "all of them". How to make that work? 

Why and when is that a good idea? Lets talk though the design considerations and then do a project that has multiple persistence mechanisms that are well orchestrated to be better than any single system.
