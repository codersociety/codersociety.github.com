How to build a future-proof system using micro-services and a language/platform agnostic messaging bus with something like ZMQ. This would show the process of writing code as a collection of miniature services that communicate over purpose built APIs using ZMQ. 

This project would show how you can use such an architecture to seamlessly scale up from a single process to multi-process to multi-machine. Greatest thing about ZMQ is that it enables this in almost any language and on any OS. To expand on the topic, we may want to consider other queues also.
